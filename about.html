        <h2>Travel and Cultural Exploration</h2>
        <p>Traveling has always been a passion of mine. Recently, I embarked on a month-long research trip to Japan, where I had the opportunity to delve into the impacts of the triple disasters of 3/11. This experience was both academically enriching and profoundly moving, as I explored the resilience and recovery of the affected communities. Following Japan, I extended my travels with a weeklong trip to Korea, immersing myself in the vibrant culture and history of the country. Each journey expands my worldview and deepens my appreciation for the diverse cultures that make up our world.</p>

        <h2>Technology in Sports</h2>
        <p>My fascination with the intersection of technology and sports has been a driving force in my academic and professional journey. I had the incredible opportunity to intern with the NBA, where I witnessed firsthand how data analytics and technology are revolutionizing the game. This experience was complemented by a school project where I developed ELO scores for NHL teams, showcasing my analytical skills and passion for sports statistics. Attending the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference further fueled my interest, as I engaged with industry experts and explored the future of sports technology.</p>

        <h2>Staying Active</h2>
        <p>Maintaining an active lifestyle is a cornerstone of my well-being. Whether it's hiking through scenic trails or playing competitive sports, staying active keeps me physically fit and mentally sharp. I have a particular passion for basketball and soccer, enjoying the camaraderie and teamwork that these sports foster. In addition to team sports, I also relish solo activities like hiking, which allow me to connect with nature and clear my mind. Each physical activity brings its own set of challenges and rewards, contributing to a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.</p>
