        <h2><a href="https://mehallhm.github.io/ds4200-project/">Consumer Spending Insights</a></h2>
        <p>This project explores the influence of location, promotions, demographics, and loyalty on consumer buying behavior. 
            By analyzing a dataset containing detailed information on consumer preferences, purchase history, and product choices, 
            we aim to understand how these factors impact the frequency of purchases and basket size. The insights derived from 
            this analysis provide businesses with practical strategies to tailor their marketing efforts, optimize sales 
            processes, and enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. Through visualizations and detailed findings, this project 
            aims to guide companies in making informed decisions to drive sales and foster long-term engagement with their target 
            audience.</p>

        <h2><a href="From Ruin to Resilience_ Post-Disaster_Population_Stability_in_Miyagi_and_Iwate.pdf">From Ruin to Resilience</a></h2>
        <p>From my <a href = "about.html#travel">travels</a> to Japan in the summer of 2024, I conducted both qualitative and quantitative research.
            on the disaster recovery process and land use in affected areas. Please read the abstract for my work here! 
            <br> <br>
            The population of Japan has faced a demographic and population crisis greatly influenced by the triple disasters 
            of March 11, 2011. These include the Great East Japan Earthquake, subsequent tsunami and Fukushima-Daiichi 
            nuclear meltdown that resulted in immense loss of lives, displacement of persons, and economic damages. The 
            lengthy recovery period that followed demonstrated the dissatisfaction among affected communities that feel 
            that there is nothing to return to. This research paper demonstrates how the effectiveness of urban planning 
            and rebuilding strategies can determine whether or not populations are maintained in disaster-affected towns. 
            It seeks to identify factors that enable some towns to better retain their populations through an examination 
            of housing destruction rates, tourism development, population density, reconstruction timelines and location. 
            The statistical analyses and case studies show that changes in housing destruction rates and population density 
            are significant drivers of population changes while factors such as city tax revenue are less important due to 
            equitable distribution of national government reconstruction funds as well as international aid. Consequently, 
            this study's findings highlight the need for prioritization of residential and commercial reconstruction over 
            disaster prevention infrastructure in order to minimize population decrease. </p>

        <h2><a href="A Better Bettor.pdf">A Bettter Bettor - ELO Modeling NHL Teams</a></h2>
        <p>The NHL project focuses on the intersection of machine learning and sports betting, addressing how bettors can use 
            artificial intelligence to make better, more rational decisions. The abstract outlines the significance of sports 
            betting in the modern entertainment landscape and the challenges it poses due to irrational decision-making and 
            addiction. It suggests that machine learning can enhance sports betting outcomes by analyzing large datasets to 
            identify patterns and trends, offering more accurate and data-driven predictions compared to human intuition. 
            The introduction provides context on the rapid growth of the sports betting industry in the U.S., driven by the 
            legalization of betting in various states. It emphasizes the need for tools like machine learning to counterbalance 
            the odds, which are generally tilted in favor of bookmakers. The methodology section details a two-step approach 
            to predictive modeling: first, predicting game outcomes using the ELO Rating System to assess team strengths, and 
            second, evaluating bookmakers’ odds to find profitable betting opportunities. The application of the Elo Rating 
            System is explained in depth, noting its self-correcting nature and the Markov property, which allows predictions 
            based on previous ratings. The model uses the difference in ELO ratings between teams to estimate expected goals, 
            leveraging a Poisson distribution to predict actual goals scored. The conclusion focuses on comparing predictive 
            models with bookmaker odds to identify value bets—those where the bettor’s implied probability is higher than the 
            bookmaker’s estimate. This project illustrates how machine learning can empower bettors by reducing reliance on 
            emotion and intuition, providing a more scientific approach to betting in hockey and, by extension, other sports. 
            The project also highlights the complexities of translating odds into profitable bets, considering factors like 
            vigorish and the bookmaker’s margin. Through this analysis, the project aims to contribute to a deeper 
            understanding of how technology can shape the sports betting landscape, offering insights into potential future 
            research directions and practical applications for bettors.</p>

        <h2>Technology in Sports</h2>
        <p>The project analyzing ticket scores in the Chase Arena for the Warriors with the NBA 
            focused on optimizing ticket pricing strategies to maximize revenue and attendance. 
            Using machine learning techniques, we developed a model to predict ticket scores, which 
            are metrics that assess the quality and value of seating options based on factors like 
            location, view, demand, and pricing elasticity. By analyzing historical ticket 
            sales data, we identified key variables influencing ticket scores, such as opponent 
            strength, day of the week, game type (regular season, playoffs), and ticket sales trends. 
            The model incorporated these variables to forecast ticket scores and recommend dynamic 
            pricing adjustments that could increase revenue while ensuring optimal fan experience. 
            This project provided valuable insights for the NBA in understanding ticket market 
            dynamics, enabling better decision-making for pricing strategies and helping the 
            Warriors optimize ticket sales and fan engagement at home games. Through this analysis, 
            we demonstrated how data science could be leveraged to enhance customer satisfaction 
            and profitability in the sports entertainment sector.
